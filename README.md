Max for Live Handpan Instrument for the Ableton Live.

![](/docs/img/max-handpan-overview.png)

## Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a custom instrument for the
[Ableton Push](https://www.ableton.com/en/push/)
(and possibly other controllers), turning the Push into a digital
[handpan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handpan)
(such as the
[hang drum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_(instrument)))
that is meant to be played like a handpan is: not just access to the tone
fields/doum, but ghost notes, taks, slaps, etc. too, as well as a layout that is
remiscent of an actual handpan. It should also be possible to configure the
handpan in various ways; as an obvious example, it should be easy to change the
scale. In fact, I am building this instrument as I am making my way through the
excellent handpan course at David Kuckhermann's
[Handpan Dojo](https://courses.handpandojo.com/).

I recorded a quick screencast to give an overview of the design:

the architecture.
