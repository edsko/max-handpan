# Scales

## Supported scales

The
[currently supported scales](/ps/src/Backend/Scale.purs) are:

* [**Kurd 9**](https://www.haganenote.com/store/kurd/).
  An Arabic scale; One of the most popular handpan scales.

  Examples:

  - The Kurd 9 used in the [Handpan Dojo](https://www.handpandojo.com/) has
    a root of A, over a doum of D.

* [**Hijaz**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygian_dominant_scale).
  The fifth mode of the harmonic minor scale.

  Also known as:

  - Phrygian dominant scale.
  - Hitzaz
  - Hijaz-Nahawand
  - Hijaz maqam

  Examples:

  - The Hijaz handpan used in the [Handpan Dojo](https://www.handpandojo.com/)
    is in D over G.

* [**Pelog**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelog).
  An Indonesian pentatonic scale.

  Also known as:

  - Melog
  - Melog/Selisir (technically "selisir" is a _mode_ of this scale)

  Examples:

  - The
    [first generation Hang sampled by Soniccouture](https://www.soniccouture.com/en/products/35-rare-and-unique/g29-pan-drums/)
    is in A over F.

* [**Integral**](https://www.sarazhandpans.com/handpan-scales/integral/).
  This is a mode of the natural minor scale (starting on the 5th degree) and
  omitting the 4th degree, ending up with a hexatonic scale.
  The doum is then normally a fifth below the root.

  Examples:

  - The
    [second generation Hang sampled by Soniccouture](https://www.soniccouture.com/en/products/35-rare-and-unique/g29-pan-drums/) 
    is in A over D.
