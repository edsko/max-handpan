# Patchers

NOTE: The JavaScript in this code is generated by the PureScript compiler.

## Velocity curve

This is intended for use with `bpatcher`. Max for Live is a bit finicky when
it comes to using [parameter names][hashvars] with dials etc., but if you add the patcher
using

```
bpatcher velocity @args SomeName
```

and then save the patcher, you should see controls `SomeName.Drive` etc.
appear in a `live.banks` instance.
